## Introduction

EmailBuilder.js is a free and open-source email template builder for developers. Build emails faster than ever with clean JSON or HTML output that render well across clients and devices.

[Use our playground](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder) or learn more about how to [get started using EmailBuilder.js](#using-emailbuilderjs).

## Build simple welcome emails to complex reports

Use a no-code builder that is flexible enough to create a wide variety of template designs – from simple welcome emails to complex reports.

Sample templates available in the playground:

- [Welcome email](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/welcome)
- [One-time passcode (OTP)](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/one-time-password)
- [Reset password](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reset-password)
- [E-commerce receipt](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/order-ecomerce)
- [SaaS subscription receipt](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/subscription-receipt)
- [Reservation reminder](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/reservation-reminder)
- [Post metrics](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/post-metrics-report)
- [Respond to inquiry](https://usewaypoint.github.io/email-builder-js/#sample/respond-to-message)

<br>

## Why?

It's finally time to stop using 90's style HTML and CSS to build product emails. EmailBuilder.js takes inspiration from [editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) and email component libraries and puts them into an easy to use no-code builder to that allow the entire team to build emails.

Since the builder is completely free and open source, teams can self-host the builder and extend as needed.

<br>

## Built-in blocks

Each block is it's own npm package that can be included in the builder. These are the ones that are built-in:

- [Avatar](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-avatar)
- [Button](https://github.com/usewaypoint/email-builder-js/tree/main/packages/block-button)

## Email builder output

The email builder can output to a clean JSON or raw HTML. You can see this from the playground by simply clicking on the HTML or JSON tabs in the builder.

## Using EmailBuilder.js

Install the package in your project:

```bash
npm install --save @usewaypoint/email-builder
```

Given an EmailBuilder.js configuration (the JSON output of the builder):

```javascript
import { TReaderDocument } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';

const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {
  root: {
    type: 'EmailLayout',
    data: {
      backdropColor: '#F8F8F8',
      canvasColor: '#FFFFFF',
      textColor: '#242424',
      fontFamily: 'MODERN_SANS',
      childrenIds: ['block-1709578146127'],
    },
  },
  'block-1709578146127': {
    type: 'Text',
    data: {
      style: {
        fontWeight: 'normal',
        padding: {
          top: 16,
          bottom: 16,
          right: 24,
          left: 24,
        },
      },
      props: {
        text: 'Hello world',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

You can render the EmailBuilder.js configuration to an HTML email string:

```javascript
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';

const string = renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' });
```

Or you can render the EmailBuilder.js configuration by using the `<Reader />` React component:

```javascript
import { Reader } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';

<Reader document={CONFIGURATION} rootBlockId="root" />;
```

<br>

## Sending emails

In most cases, you'll want to take the EmailBuilder.js configuration, render it to HTML, and then send it as an email. Here are a couple of examples on how you can do this using the same configuration from the examples above.

<br>

### Sending through nodemailer

```javascript
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';
import nodemailer from "nodemailer";

// Replace this with your transport configuration
const transportConfig = {}
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport(transportConfig);

// Replace this with the JSON for your Reader document
const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {}

await transporter.sendMail({
  from: 'no-reply@example.com'
  to: 'friend@example.com',
  subject: 'Hello',
  html: renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' }),
});
```

<br>

### Sending through an email API

We'll use [Waypoint](https://www.usewaypoint.com) for this example, however, you can use any email API like Amazon SES, SendGrid, or MailGun.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

import { renderToStaticMarkup } from '@usewaypoint/email-builder';

// Replace this with the JSON for your Reader document
const CONFIGURATION: TReaderDocument = {}

await axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://live.waypointapi.com/v1/email_messages',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  auth: {
    username: API_KEY_USERNAME,
    password: API_KEY_PASSWORD,
  },

  data: {
    from: 'no-reply@example.com'
    to: 'friend@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello',
    bodyHtml: renderToStaticMarkup(CONFIGURATION, { rootBlockId: 'root' }),
  },
});
```
