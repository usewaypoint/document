## Why?

It's time to finally stop using 90's style HTML and CSS to build product emails. EmailBuilder.js takes inspiration from [editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) and email component libraries and puts them into an easy to use no-code builder to that allow the entire team to contibute to building emails.

Since the builder is completely free and open source, teams can self-host the builder and extend as needed.
